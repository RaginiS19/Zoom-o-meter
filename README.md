# Zoom-o-Meter 🎤📉

A fake Zoom call simulator that evaluates your "Zoom performance" with completely useless metrics and chaotic fun. Built as a second contribution to the Useless Web for a Vibe Coding assignment.

## 💡 What It Does

- Fake Zoom interface with video boxes and chat popup
- Random feedback like "You're on mute!" or "Can you see my screen?"
- Performance meter that increases every time you "speak"
- Mute/Unmute toggle that disables the Speak button
- Meeting timer at the top
- Annoying interruptions like barking dogs and random crashes
- You can't leave the meeting — because you're the host now 😅

---

## 🔧 Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Zoom-inspired UI)
- JavaScript (random logic, timers, audio)

## 🤡 Why?

Because real productivity is overrated — and fake Zoom chaos is timeless.
